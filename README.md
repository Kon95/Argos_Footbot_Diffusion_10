Multi-Robot Diffusion Simulation using ARGoS
This project employs ARGoS, a powerful multi-robot simulator, to simulate the diffusion behavior of ten foot-bots in a confined square environment. Drawing inspiration from the Diffusion 10 example, each robot is equipped with a proximity sensor, enabling them to perform obstacle avoidance and navigate within the environment.

Diffusion Algorithm: The controller utilizes proximity sensor readings to calculate repulsive forces, enabling the robots to adeptly navigate around obstacles and interact with each other.
